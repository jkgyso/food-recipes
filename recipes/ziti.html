    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This baked ziti with sausage is quite possibly the one thing that I am
      constantly asked to make. It is full of flavor and delicious.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package dry ziti pasta</li>
      <li>1 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, minced</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Italian cheese blend</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil (Optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
        baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil over high
        heat. Stir in ziti and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring
        occasionally, until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8
        minutes. Drain well.
      </li>
      <li>
        While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add
        sausage; cook and stir until brown, about 10 minutes. Drain sausage and
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together ricotta, onion, egg, garlic, and oregano in a large bowl
        until well combined. Stir in pasta, sausage, salt, pepper, and the half
        jar of spaghetti sauce; mix well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the bottom of the prepared baking dish with 1/3 of the full jar
        spaghetti sauce. Layer with 1/2 of the pasta mixture, 1/2 of the
        remaining spaghetti sauce, and 1/2 of the shredded cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using remaining pasta, sauce, and cheese. Sprinkle basil over
        top and cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until heated through, about 20 minutes.
        Uncover; return to the oven and bake until cheese is melted, 5 to 10
        more minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
