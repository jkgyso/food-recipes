    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      This classic King Ranch chicken casserole is bursting with chicken, corn tortillas, tomatoes, peppers, and cheesy goodness. From what I hear, it's impossible to go to any sort of potluck in Texas and not see one of these.

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Sauté the onion, red bell pepper, and green bell pepper until they're warmed through.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir together the sautéed vegetables, canned soups, diced tomatoes, chicken broth, sour cream, and spices in a large bowl until the ingredients are well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a few tablespoons of the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Top the sauce with about half the chicken. Spread half the sauce over the chicken, then top with ⅓ of the cheese. Arrange a layer of tortillas over the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add remaining chicken, then top with the remaining sauce (reserving ½ cup). Top with ½ of the remaining cheese and remaining tortillas, then with the reserved sauce, and the remaining cheese.
